# Theoretical Foundations

## Purpose of This Document

This document situates the validation experiments within established digital humanities and game studies frameworks. The goal is demonstrating that **the methods used are reasonable and recognized**—standard approaches that would be expected in computational humanities scholarship.

We cite these frameworks to show the experiments are **methodologically grounded**, not to claim the specific findings are definitive interpretations. The theoretical scaffolding supports the validation claim: "This data can support this kind of analysis."

## Situating Computational Game Analysis

This project operates at the intersection of several scholarly traditions, each contributing analytical tools and interpretive frameworks.

---

## 1. Digital Humanities and Distant Reading

### Franco Moretti's Distant Reading

Moretti's *Graphs, Maps, Trees* (2005) and subsequent work established the principle that quantitative analysis of large textual corpora can reveal patterns invisible to traditional close reading. His network analysis of character interactions in *Hamlet* demonstrated that computational methods could illuminate dramatic structure.

**Application here**: Experiment 3's semantic network analysis applies Moretti's approach to game dialogue, treating co-occurrence patterns as evidence of thematic structure.

### Matthew Jockers' Macroanalysis

Jockers' *Macroanalysis* (2013) extended distant reading to encompass stylometric analysis, topic modeling, and sentiment tracking across thousands of novels. His work demonstrated that individual texts could be situated within broader literary-historical patterns.

**Application here**: The motif evolution analysis (Experiment 4) borrows the longitudinal tracking approach, following a single symbolic element across narrative time.

---

## 2. Transmedial Narratology

### Marie-Laure Ryan's Media-Conscious Narratology

Ryan's work on narrative across media (*Narrative across Media*, 2004) argues that narrative structures are medium-independent but their expression is medium-specific. This creates a productive tension: stories migrate across media while being transformed by each medium's affordances.

**Application here**: The structural alignment analysis (Experiment 1) treats the game as a remediation of film, asking how cinematic narrative beats are transformed by RPG Maker's interactive structure.

### Henry Jenkins' Transmedia Storytelling

Jenkins' concept of transmedia storytelling (*Convergence Culture*, 2006) emphasizes how narratives spread across platforms, with each medium contributing unique elements. While Jenkins focuses on commercial franchises, the principle applies to grassroots adaptations.

**Application here**: *小红帽* is itself a transmedia artifact, adapting fairy tale (oral/print), Soviet film, and survival horror game conventions into a new synthesis.

---

## 3. Remediation Theory

### Bolter & Grusin's Remediation

*Remediation: Understanding New Media* (1999) argues that all media refashion prior media through two logics:
- **Immediacy**: The desire to erase the medium, creating transparent access to content
- **Hypermediacy**: The acknowledgment and celebration of mediation itself

New media oscillate between these poles, simultaneously evoking and transforming their predecessors.

**Application here**: *小红帽* remediates *Ballad of a Soldier* through hypermediacy—it doesn't hide its debt to the film but transforms it through RPG Maker's distinctive affordances (player agency, spatial exploration, combat systems).

---

## 4. Spatial Storytelling in Games

### Henry Jenkins' Environmental Storytelling

Jenkins' "Game Design as Narrative Architecture" (2004) identifies four ways games create narrative experiences:
1. **Evocative spaces**: Referencing existing stories
2. **Enacted stories**: Player-performed narratives
3. **Embedded narratives**: Environmental clues revealing backstory
4. **Emergent narratives**: Stories arising from gameplay systems

**Application here**: Experiment 2's narrative density analysis maps how story content is distributed across game space, revealing the spatial logic of narrative delivery.

### Clara Fernández-Vara's Spatial Analysis

Fernández-Vara's work on adventure games and spatial storytelling (*Introduction to Game Analysis*, 2019) provides vocabulary for analyzing how game spaces encode narrative meaning through layout, navigation constraints, and environmental design.

**Application here**: The finding that 83% of maps are combat/traversal-focused while narrative concentrates in specific hubs reflects what Fernández-Vara calls "narrative pacing through space."

---

## 5. Formalist Approaches to Narrative

### Vladimir Propp's Morphology

Propp's *Morphology of the Folktale* (1928) decomposed Russian fairy tales into 31 narrative functions that could combine in various sequences. This structural approach treats narrative elements as transformable units rather than fixed content.

**Application here**: Experiment 4 tracks how the "Little Red Riding Hood" function transforms across the game—the name remains constant while its semantic associations shift dramatically.

### Structuralist Narratology

Genette's distinction between *histoire* (story), *récit* (narrative discourse), and *narration* (the act of telling) provides tools for analyzing how the same story-level events can be presented differently through medium-specific discourse.

**Application here**: The game shares story-level beats with *Ballad of a Soldier* but presents them through radically different discourse—interactive exploration rather than cinematic montage.

---

## 6. Game-Specific Frameworks

### Procedural Rhetoric (Bogost)

Ian Bogost's *Persuasive Games* (2007) argues that games make arguments through their rule systems—"procedural rhetoric." What a game lets you do (and prevents you from doing) constitutes its ideological claim.

**Application here**: The concentration of narrative in hub areas while combat dominates traversal spaces procedurally argues that war is mostly violence punctuated by brief human moments—a claim resonant with *Ballad of a Soldier*'s own anti-war rhetoric.

### Ludology vs. Narratology Debates

The early 2000s debate between ludologists (games are rule systems first) and narratologists (games can be analyzed as stories) has largely resolved into productive synthesis. This project treats game data as both:
- **Ludic structure**: Command types, map layouts, event triggers
- **Narrative content**: Dialogue, character relationships, symbolic evolution

---

## 7. Cultural Studies of Chinese Games

### Chinese Indie Game Scenes

The 66rpg.com community represents a distinct historical moment in Chinese game development—before Steam's Chinese expansion, before mobile dominance, when amateur creators made RPG Maker games for local audiences with no expectation of commercial distribution or international recognition.

**Critical context**: These games reflect specifically Chinese engagements with imported cultural forms (fairy tales, Soviet cinema, Japanese RPG conventions), producing hybrid artifacts that deserve analysis on their own terms rather than as derivatives of "original" Western/Japanese forms.

### Translation and Adaptation Studies

Chinese creative adaptation often involves what Lydia Liu calls "translingual practice"—the productive transformation of foreign concepts through domestication. *小红帽* doesn't simply translate Little Red Riding Hood; it transforms the tale through Chinese cultural logics.

---

## Synthesis: Why These Frameworks?

These theoretical foundations serve a specific purpose: **demonstrating methodological legitimacy**.

Each experiment maps to established DH practice:

| Experiment | Theoretical Basis | Validation Claim |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Structural Alignment | Remediation theory, transmedial narratology | "Intertextual hypothesis testing is a recognized method" |
| Narrative Density | Spatial storytelling, environmental narrative | "Spatial metrics have theoretical grounding" |
| Semantic Network | Distant reading, network analysis | "Co-occurrence analysis is standard DH practice" |
| Motif Evolution | Proppian morphology, diachronic analysis | "Symbol tracking follows established approaches" |

The goal is showing that **the extracted data supports methods that reviewers will recognize as legitimate**, not that these particular interpretations are correct.

### What This Establishes

1. **Methods are standard**: Not invented for this project
2. **Frameworks are cited**: Grounded in existing scholarship
3. **Application is reasonable**: Methods fit the data type
4. **Interpretation is enabled**: Frameworks provide vocabulary for discussion

### What This Does NOT Establish

- That our specific readings are the only valid ones
- That quantitative outputs settle interpretive questions
- That these frameworks are the only applicable ones

The theoretical apparatus supports the **infrastructure claim**: this data is ready for computational humanities work using recognized methods.
